Eating is something we <strong>do</strong> every day, but it is not just about feeling full. Food <strong>is</strong> the fuel for our bodies and our brains. A healthy, balanced diet <strong>has</strong> many <strong>powerful</strong> benefits. <strong>It is</strong> a truly <strong>wonderful</strong> way to give your body all the energy and vitamins it needs to feel strong and healthy. Our bodies <strong>are</strong> like a complex machine, and they <strong>must</strong> have the right fuel to work well.

Good eating habits <strong>have</strong> positive effects on our minds and bodies. When you eat lots of fruits and vegetables, your mind <strong>is</strong> sharp and you have a <strong>greatness</strong> of energy for school and playing sports. The experience <strong>is</strong> more <strong>enjoyable</strong> when you feel good. A healthy diet <strong>is</strong> always the right choice. <strong>It is</strong> a simple rule we <strong>have to</strong> follow for a good life.

On the other hand, unhealthy foods like sugary snacks and greasy fries <strong>do</strong> not <strong>have</strong> the vitamins we need. A diet <strong>full</strong> of these things can lead to a feeling of <strong>laziness</strong>. Without the right nutrients, our bodies <strong>are helpless</strong> to fight sickness. The <strong>usefulness</strong> of a healthy meal is its ability to make you feel strong and happy. You <strong>must</strong> remember to choose foods that are good for you, not just for a moment.`,
